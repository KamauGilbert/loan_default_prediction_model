🏦 **Loan Prediction Model**

This machine learning project aims to build a model that predicts whether a person would default on a loan based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

🔗 Check out the initial commits to explore the project's beginnings.

📈 I will continuously update the repository with every progress made.

🚀 I plan to deploy the model locally using FastAPI, Streamlit or Flask for easy accessibility and testing.

This is interesting
